You rocked this.  Nice website, nice use of CSS, everything.

The one thing I'd suggest about your code is that you might have been able to
repeat yourself less about returning HTTP error/OK headers if you wrote a
function to do so that took the HTTP code and the message and output the HTTP
header line.  Other than that, keep on keeping on.
