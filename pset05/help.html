<p>This website has been created for the sixth problem set in the Spring 2013 semester of the Transcode class. The purpose of this assignment was to implement a web server coded in Python and to upload HTML and CSS files on this web server. You will notice that the page you are currently on has no styling, while the main page uses CSS styling.</p>
<p>If you attempt to access a page that does not exist on this webserver, or if you attempt make requests of the server that are not webpage GET requests, you will find that the webserver replies to these requests with appropriate error messages.</p>
<p>The story of Caeneus from Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i> was selected because the story is about a hero who begins life as a woman and is later transformed into a man. When Caeneus is defeated in the war between the Centaurs and the Lapiths (Centauromachy), he escapes death by transforming into a bird.</p>
