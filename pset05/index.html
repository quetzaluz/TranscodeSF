<p>There was a truce for many days after this opening fight 
<p>while both sides resting, laid aside their arms.</p>
<p>A watchful guard patroled the Phrygian walls;</p>
<p>the Grecian trenches had their watchful guard.</p>
<p>Then, on a festal day, Achilles gave the blood of a slain</p> 
<p>heifer to obtain the favor of Athena for their cause.</p>
<p>The entrails burned upon the altar, while the odor, </p>
<p>grateful to the deities, was mounting to the skies. </p>
<p>When sacred rites were done, a banquet for the heroes was</p>
<p>served on their tables. There the Grecian chiefs reclined on couches; </p>
<p>while they satisfied themselves with roasted flesh, </p>
<p>and banished cares: and thirst with wine.</p> 
<p>Nor harp nor singing voice nor long pipe made of </p>
<p>boxwood pierced with holes, delighted them. They talked of their </p>
<p>own deeds and valor, all that thrilling night: and even</p>
<p>the strength of enemies whom they had met and overcome.</p>
<p>What else could they admit or think of, while the great Achilles spoke</p>
<p>or listened to them? But especially the recent victory over Cygnus held</p>
<p>them ardent. Wonderful it seemed to them that such a youth could be </p>
<p>composed of flesh not penetrable by the sharpest spear;</p>
<p>of flesh which blunted even hardened steel, </p> 
<p>and never could be wounded. All the Greeks</p> 
<p>and even Achilles wondered at the thought.</p>
<p>Then Nestor said to them: "During your time, Cygnus has been the only </p>
<p>you knew who could despise all weapons and whose flesh</p>
<p>could not be pierced by thrust of sword or spear. But long ago</p> 
<p>I saw another man able to bear unharmed a thousand strokes,</p>
<p>Caeneus of Thessaly, Caeneus who lived upon Mt. Othrys. 
<p>He was famed in war yet, strange to say,</p>
<p>by birth he was a woman!" Then all expressed the greatest wonderment,</p> 
<p>and begged to hear the story of his life. Achilles cried,</p>
<p>"O eloquent old man! The wisdom of our age! </p>
<p>All of us wish to hear, who was this Caeneus?</p>
<p>Why was he changed to the other sex? in what campaigns, and in</p>
<p>what wars was he so known to you? </p>
<p>Who conquered him, if any ever did?"</p>
<p>The aged man replied to them with care:--</p>
<p>"Although my great age is a harm to me, and many actions of my early days</p>
<p>escape my memory; yet, most of them are well remembered. Nothing of old</p>
<p>days, amid so many deeds of war and peace, can be more firmly fixed</p>
<p>upon my mind than the strange story I shall tell of him. If long extent</p>
<p>of years made anyone a witness of most wonderful events and many,</p>
<p>truly I may say to you that I have lived two centuries, and now three.</p>
<p>The daughter of Elatus, Caenis, was remarkable for charm--</p>
<p>most beautiful of all Thessalian maidens--</p>
<p>many sighed for her in vain through all the neighboring towns</p> 
<p>and yours, Achilles, for that was her home.</p>
<p>But Peleus did not try to win her love,</p>
<p>for he was either married at that time</p>
<p>to your dear mother, or was pledged to her. Caenis never became </p>
<p>the willing bride of any suitor; but report declares, while she was</p>
<p>walking on a lonely shore, the god of ocean saw and ravished her.</p>
<p>And in the joy of that love Neptune said, 'Request of me</p>
<p>whatever you desire, and nothing shall deny your dearest wish!'--</p>
<p>the story tells us that he made this pledge. And Caenis said to Neptune,</p><p>'The great wrong, which I have suffered from you justifies the wonderful</p>
<p>request that I must make; I ask that I may never suffer such an injury again</p>
<p>Grant I may be no longer woman, and I'll ask no more.'</p>
<p>while she was speaking to him, the last words of her strange prayer </p> 
<p>were uttered in so deep, in such a manly tone, it seemed indeed they</p>
<p>must be from a man.--That was a fact: Neptune not only had allowed </p>
<p>her prayer but made the new man proof against all wounds of spear</p>
<p>or sword. Rejoicing in the gift he went his way as Caeneus Atracides,</p> 
<p>spent years in every manful exercise, and roamed the plains of Thessaly.</p>
<p>"The son of bold Ixion, Pirithous wedding Hippodame, had asked as guests</p>
<p>the cloud-born centaurs to recline around the ordered tables,</p>
<p>in a cool cave, set under some shading trees. Thessalian chiefs</p>
<p>were there and I myself was with them there. The festal place resounded</p>
<p>with the rout in noisy clamor, singing nuptial verse;</p>
<p>and in the great room, filled with smoking fire, the maiden came</p>
<p>escorted by a crowd of matrons and young married women; she most beautiful</p>
<p>of all that lovely throng. And so Pirithous, the fortunate son of bold Ixion</p>
<p>was so praised by all, for his pure joy and lovely wife,</p>
<p>it seemed his very blessings must have led to fatal harm:</p>
<p>for savage Eurytus, wildest of the wild centaurs, now inflamed</p>
<p>with sudden envy, drunkenness, and lust, upset the tables</p>
<p>and made havoc there so dreadful, that the banquet suddenly was changed </p>
<p>from love to uproar. Seized by the hair, the bride was violently dragged away.</p>
<p>When Eurytus caught up Hippodame, each one of all the centaurs took at will</p>
<p>the maid or matron that he longed for most. The palace, </p>
<p>seeming like a captured town, resounded with affrighted shrieks of women.</p>
<p>At once we all sprang up. And Theseus cried, "What madness, Eurytus, </p>
<p>has driven you to this vile wickedness! While I have life, you dare</p>
<p>attack Pirithous. You know not what you do, for one wrong injures both!'</p>
<p>The valiant hero did not merely talk: he pushed them off</p>
<p>as they were pressing on, and rescued her whom Eurytus had seized.</p>
<p>Since Eurytus could not defend such deeds with words, he turned</p>
<p>and beat with violent hands the face of him who saved the bride and struck</p>
<p>his generous breast. By chance, an ancient bowl was near at hand.</p>
<p>This rough with figures carved, the son of Aegeus caught and hurled it full</p>
<p>in that vile centaur's face. He, spouting out thick gouts of blood,</p>
<p>and bleeding from his wounds--his brains and wine mixed,--
<p>kicked the blood-soaked sand.</p>
<p>His double membered centaur brothers, wild</p>
<p>with passion at his death, all shouted out,</p>
<p>'To arms! to arms!' Their courage raised by wine!</p>
<p>In their first onset, hurled cups flew about, and shattered wine casks,</p>
<p>hollow basins--things before adapted to a banquet, now</p>
<p>for death and carnage in the furious fight.</p>
<p>Amycus first (Opinion's son) began to spoil the inner sanctuary of its gifts.</p>
<p>He snatched up from that shrine a chandelier,</p>
<p>adorned with glittering lamps, and lifted high,</p>
<p>with all the force of one who strives to break</p>
<p>the bull's white neck with sacrificial axe,</p>
<p>he dashed it at the head of Celadon, one of the Lapithae,</p>
<p>and crushed his skull into the features of his face. 
<p>His eyes leaped from his sockets, and the shattered bones of his smashed face</p>
<p>gave way so that his nose was driven back and fastened in his throat.</p>
<p>But Belates of Pella tore away a table-leg of maple wood and felled</p>
<p>Amycus to the ground; his sunken chin cast down upon his breast;</p> 
<p>and, as he spat his teeth out mixed with blood, a second blow</p>
<p>despatched him to the shades of Tartarus.</p>
<p>Gryneus, seeing a smoking altar, cried,</p>
<p>'Good use for this,' with which words he raised up</p>
<p>that heavy, blazing altar. Hurling it</p>
<p>into the middle of the Lapithae,</p>
<p>he struck down Broteas and Orius: Mycale, mother of that Orius,</p>
<p>was famous for her incantations, which she had often used to conjure down</p>
<p>the shining twin-horns of the unwilling moon.</p>
<p>Exadius threatened, 'You shall not escape! Let me but have a weapon!'</p>
<p>And with that, he whirled the antlers of a votive stag,</p>
<p>which he found there, hung on a tall pine-tree;</p>
<p>and with that double-branching horn he pierced the eyes of Gryneus,</p> 
<p>and he gouged them out. One eye stuck to the horn; the other rolled</p>
<p>down on his beard, to which it strictly clung in dreadful clotted gore.</p>
<p>Then Rhoetus snatched a blazing brand of plum-wood from an altar</p>
<p>and whirling it upon the right, smashed through</p>
<p>the temples of Charaxus, wonderful with golden hair.</p>
<p>Seized by the violent flames, his yellow locks burned fiercely, as a field</p>
<p>of autumn grain; and even the scorching blood</p>
<p>gave from the sore wound a terrific noise</p>
<p>as a red-hot iron in pincers which the smith</p>
<p>lifts out and plunges in the tepid pool, hissing and sizzling. </p>
<p>Charaxus shook the fire from his burnt locks; and heaved up on</p>
<p>his shoulders a large threshold stone torn from the ground--</p>
<p>a weight sufficient for a team of oxen.</p>
<p>The vast weight impeded him, so that it could not even touch his foe--</p>
<p>and yet, the massive stone did hit his friend, Cometes,</p>
<p>who was standing near to him, and crushed him down.</p>
<p>Then Rhoetus, crazed with joy, exulting yelled, 'I pray that all of you</p>
<p>may be so strong!' Wielding his half-burnt stake</p>
<p>with heavy blows again and again, he broke</p>
<p>the sutures of his enemy's skull, until</p>
<p>the bones were mingled with his oozing brains.</p>
<p>Victorious, then rushed he upon Evagrus, and Corythus and Dryas</p>
<p>First of these was youthful Corythus, whose cheeks were then just covered</p>
<p>with soft down. When he fell dead, Evagrus cried, 'What glory do you get,</p>
<p>killing a boy?' But Rhoetus did not give him time for uttering one word more.</p>
<p>He pushed the red hot stake into the foeman's mouth,</p>
<p>while he still spoke, and down into his lungs.</p>
<p>He then pursued the savage Dryas, while</p>
<p>whirling the red fire fast about his head;</p>
<p>but not with like success, for, while he still rejoiced in killings, </p>
<p>Dryas turned and pierced him with a stake where neck and shoulder meet.</p>
<p>Rhoetus groaned and with a great effort pulled the stake out from the bone</p>
<p>then fled away, drenched in his blood.</p>
<p>And Orneus followed him. Lycabas fled,</p>
<p>and Medon with a wound in his right shoulder. Thaumas and Pisenor</p>
<p>and Mermerus fled with them. He used to excell all others in a race,</p>
<p>but now Mermerus ran slowly, crippled by a recent wound.</p>
<p>Pholus and Melaneus ran for their lives and with them Abas, hunter of wild boars</p>
<p>and Asbolus, the augur, who in vain had urged his friends to shun that hapless fight.</p>
<p>As Nessus joined the rout, he said to him,</p>
<p>'You need not flee, for you shall be reserved a victim for the bow of Hercules!'</p>
<p>but neither Lycidas, Eurynomus nor Areos, nor Imbreus had escaped</p>
<p>from death: for all of these the strong right hand of Dryas pierced,</p>
<p>as they confronted him. Crenaeus there received a wound in front.</p>
<p>Although he turned in flight, as he looked back,</p>
<p>a heavy javelin between his eyes, pierced through him,</p>
<p>where his nose and forehead joined.</p>
<p>In all this uproar, Aphidas lay flat, in endless slumber from the wine</p>
<p>he drank, incessant, and his nerveless hand still held</p>
<p>the cup of mixed wine, as he lay full stretched,</p>
<p>upon a shaggy bear-skin from Mount Ossa.</p>
<p>When Phorbas saw him, harmless in that sleep, he laid</p>
<p>his fingers in his javelin's thong, and shouted loudly, 'Mix your wine,</p>
<p>down there, with waters of the Styx!' And stopping talk, let fly</p>
<p>his javelin at the sleeping youth--the ashen shaft, iron-tipped was driven</p>
<p>through his neck, exposed, as he by chance lay there-- his head thrown back.</p>
<p>He did not even feel a touch of death--and from his deep-pierced throat his</p>
<p>crimson blood flowed out upon the couch, and in his wine-bowl still grasped.</p>
<p>I saw Petraeus when he strove to tear up from the earth,</p>
<p>an acorn-bearing oak. And, while he struggled with it,</p>
<p>back and forth, and was just ready to wrench up the trunk,</p>
<p>Pirithous hurled a well aimed spear at him,</p>
<p>transfixed his ribs, and pinned his body tight,</p>
<p>writhing, to that hard oak: and Lycus fell</p>
<p>and Chromis fell, before Pirithous. They gave less</p>
<p>glory to the conqueror than Helops or than Dictys.</p>
<p>Helops was killed by a javelin, which pierced his temples</p>
<p>from the right side, clear through to his left ear.</p>
<p>And Dictys, running in a desperate haste, hoping in vain,</p>
<p>to escape Ixion's son, slipped on the steep edge of a precipice;</p>
<p>and, as he fell down headlong crashed into the top of a huge ash-tree,</p>
<p>which impaled his dying body on its broken spikes.</p>
<p>Aphareus, eager to avenge him tried to lift a rock from that steep mountain side;</p>
<p>but as he heaved, the son of Aegeus struck him squarely with an oaken club;</p>
<p>and smashed, and broke the huge bones of that centaur's arm.</p>
<p>He has no time, and does not want to give that useless foe to death.</p>
<p>He leaps upon the back of tall Bienor, never trained to carry riders,</p>
<p>and he fixed his knees firm in the centaur's ribs, and holding tight</p>
<p>to the long hair, seized by his left hand, struck</p>
<p>and shattered the hard features and fierce face</p>
<p>and bony temples with his club of gnarled strong oak.</p>
<p>And with it, he struck to the ground</p>
<p>Nedymnus and Lycopes, dart expert, and Hippasus,</p>
<p>whose beard hid all his breast. And Rhipheus</p>
<p>taller than the highest trees and Thereus, who would carry home</p>
<p>alive the raging bears, caught in the Thessalian hills.</p>
<p>Demoleon could no longer stand and look on Theseus and his</p>
<p>unrestrained success. He struggled with vast effort to tear up</p>
<p>an old pine, trunk and all, with its long roots, and, failing shortly</p>
<p>in that first attempt, he broke it off and hurled it at his foe.</p>
<p>But Theseus saw the pine tree in its flight and, warned by Pallas,</p>
<p>got beyond its range--his boast was, Pallas had directed him!</p>
<p>And yet, the missle was not launched in vain. It sheared</p> 
<p>the left shoulder and the breast from tall Crantor.</p>
<p>He, Achilles, was your father's armor bearer</p>
<p>and was given by King Amyntor,</p>
<p>when he sued for peace.</p>
<p>When Peleus at a distance saw him torn and mangled, he exclaimed</p>
<p>'At least receive this sacrifice, O Crantor most beloved! Dearest of young</p>
<p>men!' And with sturdy arm and all his strength of soul as well, he hurled</p>
<p>his ashen lance against Demoleon, which piercing through his shivered ribs,</p>
<p>hung there and quivered in the bones. The centaur wrenched the wooden shaft out</p>
<p>with his frenzied hands, but could not move the pointed head, which stuck</p>
<p>within his lungs. His very anguish gave him such a desperation, that he rose</p>
<p>against his foe and trampled and beat down the hero with his hoofs,</p>
<p>Peleus allowed the blows to fall on helm and ringing shield. Protected so,</p>
<p>he watched his time and thrust up through the centaur's shoulder.</p>
<p>By one stroke he pierced two breasts,</p>
<p>where horse and man-form met.</p>
<p>Before this, Peleus with the spear had killed</p>
<p>both Myles and Phlegraeus and with the sword</p>
<p>Iphinous and Clanis. Now he killed</p>
<p>Dorylas, who was clad in a wolfskin cap</p>
<p>and fought with curving bull's horns dripping blood.</p>
<p>To him I said, for courage gave me strength,</p>
<p>'Your horns! how much inferior to my steel!'--</p>
<p>and threw my spear. Since he could not avoid the gleaming point,</p>
<p>he held up his right hand to shielf his forehead from the threatened wound.</p>
<p>His hand was pierced and pinned against his forehead. He shouted madly.</p>
<p>Peleus, near him while he stood there pinned and helpless with his wound,</p>
<p>struck him with sharp sword in the belly deep.</p>
<p>He leaped forth fiercely, as he trailed his bowels upon the ground</p>
<p>with his entangled legs, treading on them, bursting them,</p>
<p>he fell with empty belly, lifeless to the earth.</p>
<p>Cyllarus, beauty did not save your life--if beauty is in any of your tribe--</p>
<p>your golden beard was in its early growth, your golden hair came flowing,/p>
<p>to your shoulders. In your bright face there was a pleasing glance.</p>
<p>The neck and shoulders and the hands and breast, and every aspect of his</p> <p>human form resembled those admired statues which our gifted artists carve.</p> 
<p>Even the shape of the fine horse beneath the human form was perfect too.</p>
<p>Give him the head and neck of a full-blooded horse,</p>
<p>and he would seem a steed for Castor, for his back was shaped</p>
<p>so comfortable to be sat upon and muscle swelled upon his arching chest.</p>
<p>His lustrous body was as black as pitch,</p>
<p>and yet his legs and flowing tail were white as snow.</p>
<p>Many a female of his kind loved him, but only Hylonome gained</p>
<p>his love. There was no other centaur maid</p>
<p>so beautiful as she within the woods.</p>
<p>By coaxing ways she had won Cyllarus, by loving and confessing love.</p>
<p>By daintiness, so far as that was possible in one of such a form,</p>
<p>she held his love; for now she smoothed her long locks with a comb;</p>
<p>and now she decked herself with rosemary and now with violets and</p>
<p>roses in her hair; and sometimes she wore lilies, white as snow;</p>
<p>and twice each day she bathed her lovely face, in the sweet stream</p>
<p>that falls down from the height of wooded Pagasa; and daily, twice</p>
<p>she dipped her body in the stream. She wore upon her shoulders and left side<p>a skin, greatly becoming, of selected worth. Their love was equal,</p>
<p>and together they would wander over mountain-sides, and rest together</p>
<p>in cool caves; and so it was, they went together to that palace-cave,</p>
<p>known to the Lapithae. Together they fought fiercely in this battle,</p> 
<p>side by side. Thrown by an unknown hand, a javelin pierced</p>
<p>Cyllarus, just below the fatal spot where the chest rises to the neck--</p>
<p>his heart, though only slightly wounded, grew quite cold, and whis whole</p>
<p>body felt cold, afterwards, as quickly as the weapon was drawn out.</p>
<p>Then Hylonome held in her embrace the dying body;</p>
<p>fondled the dread wound and, fixing her lips closely to his lips</p>
<p>endeavored to hold back his dying breath.</p>
<p>But soon she saw that he indeed was dead.</p>
<p>With mourning words, which clamor of the fight prevented me from hearing,</p>
<p>she threw herself on the spear that pierced her Cyllarus and fell</p>
<p>upon his breast, embracing him in death.</p>
<p>Another sight still comes before my eyes, the centaur Phaeocomes with his log.</p>
<p>He wore six lion skins well wrapped around his body,</p>
<p>and with fixed connecting knots they covered him, both horse and man.</p>
<p>He hurled a trunk two yokes of oxen scarce could move and struck</p>
<p>the hapless son of Olenus a crushing blow upon the head. The broad</p>
<p>round dome was shattered, and his dying brains oozed out through hollow</p>
<p>nostrils, mouth, and ears, as curdled milk seeps down through oaken twigs;</p>
<p>or other liquors, crushed out under weights, flow through a well pierced sieve</p>
<p>and, thick, squeeze out through numerous holes.</p>
<p>As he began to spoil his victim--and your father can affirm</p>
<p>the truth of this--I thrust my sword deep in the wretch's groin.</p>
<p>Chthonius, too, and Teleboas fell there by my sword.</p>
<p>The former had a two-pronged stick as his sole weapon,</p>
<p>and the other had a spear, with which the wounded me.</p>
<p>You see the scar. The old scar still is surely visible!</p>
<p>Those were my days of youth and strength, and then</p>
<p>I ought to have warred against the citadel of Pergama.</p>
<p>I could have checked, or even vanquished, the arms of Hector: but, alas,</p>
<p>Hector had not been born, or was perhaps a boy. Old age has dulled</p>
<p>my youthful strength. What use is it, to speak of Periphas,</p>
<p>who overcame Pyretus, double-formed? Why tell of Ampyx,</p>
<p>who with pointless shaft, victorious thrust Echeclus through the face?</p>
<p>Macareus, hurling a heavy crowbar pierced Erigdupus and laid him low.</p>
<p>A hunting spear that Nessus strongly hurled,</p>
<p>was buried in the groin of Cymelus.</p>
<p>Do not believe that Mopsus, son of Ampycus, was merely a prophet of</p>
<p>events to come, he slew a daring two-formed monster there.</p>
<p>Hodites tried in vain to speak, before his death, but could not,</p>
<p>for his tongue was nailed against his chin, his chin against his throat.</p>
<p>Five of the centaurs Caeneus put to death: Styphelus, Bromus,</p>
<p>and Antimachus, Elymus, and Pyracmos with his axe.</p>
<p>I have forgot their wounds but noted well their names and number.</p>
<p>Latreus, huge of limb, had killed and stripped Emathian Halesus.</p>
<p>Now in his armor he came rushing out, in years he was between</p>
<p>old age and youth; but he retained the vigor of his youth;</p>
<p>his temples showed his hair was mixed with grey.</p>
<p>Conspicuous for his Macedonian lance and sword and shield,</p>
<p>facing both sides--each way, he insolently clashed his arms;</p>
<p>and while he rode poured out these words in empty air.</p>
<p>'Shall I put up with one like you, O Caeneus?</p>
<p>For you are still a woman in my sight.</p>
<p>Have you forgot your birth or that disgrace by which you won reward--</p>
<p>at what a price you got the false resemblance to a man?!</p>
<p>Consider both your birth, and what you have submitted to!</p>
<p>Take up a distaff, and wool basket! Twist your threads with practiced thumb!</p>
<p>Leave warfare to your men!' While puffed-up pride</p>
<p>was vaunting out such nonsense, Caeneus hurled</p>
<p>a spear and pierced the stretched out running side,</p>
<p>just where the man was joined upon the horse.</p>
<p>The Centaur, Latreus, raved with pain and struck with his great pike,</p>
<p>the face of Caeneus. His pike rebounded as the hail that slants</p>
<p>up from the roof; or as a pebble might rebound from hollow drum.</p>
<p>Then coming near, he tried to drive a sword into the hard side</p>
<p>of Caeneus, but it could not make a wound.</p>
<p>'Aha!' he cried, 'this will not get you off. The good edge of</p>
<p>my sword will take your life, although the point is blunt!' He turned the edge</p>
<p>against the flank of Caeneus and swung round the hero's loins with his long, </p>
<p>curving arm. The flesh resounded like a marble block, the keen blade shattered</p>
<p>on the unyielding skin. And, after Caeneus had exposed his limbs</p>
<p>unhurt to Latreus, who stood there amazed,</p>
<p>'Come now,' he said, 'and let us try my steel</p>
<p>against your body!' And, clear to the hilt, down through the monster's</p>
<p>shoulder-blade he plungedhis deadly sword and, turning it again,</p>
<p>deep in the Centaur's entrails, made new wounds within his wound.</p>
<p>Then, quite beside themselves, the double-natured monsters rushed against</p>
<p>that single-handed youth with huge uproar, and thrust</p>
<p>and hurled their weapons all at him. Their blunted weapons fell</p>
<p>and he remained unharmed and without even a mark.</p>
<p>That strange sight left them speechless. 'Oh what shame!'</p>
<p>at length cried Monychus, 'Our mighty host,--</p>
<p>a nation of us, are defeated and defied by one who is hardly a man. Although,</p>
<p>indeed, he is a man, and we have proved,  by our weak action, we are certainly</p>
<p>what he was! Shame on us! Oh, what if we have twofold strength, of what avail</p>
<p>our huge and mighty limbs, doubly united in the strongest, hugest bodies</p>
<p>in this world? And how can I believe that we were born of any goddess?</p>
<p>It is surely vain to claim descent of great Ixion, who high-souled</p>
<p>sought Juno for his mighty mate; imagine it, while we are conquered by an</p>
<p>enemy, who is but half a man! Wake up! and let us heap tree-trunks and</p>
<p>stones and mountains on him! Crush his stubborn life! Let forests</p>
<p>smother him to death! Their weight will be as deadly as a hundred wounds!</p>
<p>While he was raving, by some chance he found</p>
<p>a tree thrown down there by the boisterous wind:</p>
<p>example to the rest, he threw that tree against the powerful foe;</p>
<p>and in short time Othrys was bare of trees, and Pelion had no shade.</p>
<p>Buried under that mountainous forest heap, Caeneus heaved up</p>
<p>against the weight of oaks upon his brawny shoulders piled./p>
<p>But, as the load increased above his face and head,</p>
<p>he could not draw a breath. Gasping for life,</p>
<p>he strove to lift his head into the air,</p>
<p>and sometimes he convulsed the towering mass,</p>
<p>as if great Ida, now before our eyes,</p>
<p>should tremble with some heaving of the earth.</p>
<p>What happened to him could not well be known. Some thought his body</p>
<p>was borne down by weight into the vast expanse of Tartarus.</p>
<p>The son of Ampycus did not agree,</p>
<p>for from the middle of the pile we saw</p>
<p>a bird with golden wings mount high in air.</p>
<p>Before or since, I never saw the like. When Mopsus was aware of</p>
<p>that bird's flight--it circled round the camp on rustling wings--</p>
<p>with eyes and mind he followed it and shouted aloud:</p>
<p>'Hail, glory of the Lapithaean race,</p>
<p>their greatest hero, now a bird unique!'</p>
<p>and we believed the verdict of the seer. Out grief increased resentment,</p>
<p>and we bore it with disgust that one was overwhelmed by such a multitude.</p>
<p>Then in revenge we plied our swords, till half our foes were dead,</p>
<p>and only flight and darkness saved the rest."</p>

<p>Hic labor, haec requiem multorum pugna dierum</p>
<p>attulit, et positis pars utraque substitit armis.</p>
<p>Dumque vigil Phrygios servat custodia muros</p>
<p>et vigil Argolicas servat custodia fossas,</p>
<p>festa dies aderat, qua Cygni victor Achilles</p>
<p>Pallada mactatae placabat sanguine vaccae.</p>
<p>Cuius ut inposuit prosecta calentibus aris</p>
<p>et dis acceptus penetravit in aethera nidor,</p>
<p>sacra tulere suam, pars est data cetera mensis.</p>
<p>Discubuere toris proceres et corpora tosta</p>
<p>carne replent vinoque levant curasque sitimque.</p>
<p>Non illos citharae, non illos carmina vocum</p>
<p>longave multifori delectat tibia buxi,</p>
<p>sed noctem sermone trahunt, virtusque loquendi</p>
<p>materia est: pugnas referunt hostisque suasque,</p>
<p>inque vices adita atque exhausta pericula saepe</p>
<p>commemorare iuvat,-- quid enim loqueretur Achilles,</p>
<p>aut quid apud magnum potius loquerentur Achillem?</p>
<p>Proxima praecipue domito victoria Cygno</p>
<p>in sermone fuit. Visum mirabile cunctis,</p>
<p>quod iuvenis corpus nullo penetrabile telo</p>
<p>invictumque a vulnere erat ferrumque terebat.</p>
<p>Hoc ipse Aeacides, hoc mirabantur Achivi,</p>
<p>cum sic Nestor ait: "Vestro fuit unicus aevo</p>
<p>contemptor ferri nulloque forabilis ictu</p>
<p>Cygnus. At ipse olim patientem vulnera mille</p>
<p>corpore non laeso Perrhaebum Caenea vidi,</p>
<p>Caenea Perrhaebum, qui factis inclitus Othryn</p>
<p>incoluit; quoque id mirum magis esset in illo,</p>
<p>femina natus erat." Monstri novitate feruntur</p>
<p>quisquis adest, narretque rogant. Quos inter Achilles:</p>
<p>"Dic age! nam cunctis eadem est audire voluntas,</p>

<p>quis fuerit Caeneus, cur in contraria versus,</p>

<p>Tum senior: "Quamvis obstet mihi tarda vetustas,</p>

<p>Temptasset Peleus thalamos quoque forsitan illos,</p>

<p>"Magnum" Caenis ait "facit haec iniuria votum;</p>

<p>Munere laetus abit studiisque virilibus aevum</p>

<p>Duxerat Hippodamen audaci Ixione natus,</p>

<p>Haemonii proceres aderant, aderamus et ipsi,</p>

<p>Ecce canunt Hymenaeon, et ignibus atria fumant,</p>

<p>Eurytus Hippodamen, alii, quam quisque probabant,</p>

<p>Femineo clamore sonat domus: ocius omnes</p>

<p>"Euryte, pulsat" ait, "qui me vivente lacessas</p>

<p>neve ea magnanimus frustra memoraverit heros,</p>

<p>Forte fuit iuxta signis exstantibus asper</p>

<p>Sanguinis ille globos pariter cerebrumque merumque</p>

<p>Vina dabant animos, et prima pocula pugna</p>

<p>Primus Ophionides Amycus penetralia donis</p>

<p>Ecce rapit mediis flagrantem Rhoetus ab aris</p>
<p>pruniceum torrem dextraque a parte Charaxi</p>

<p>Correpti rapida, veluti seges arida, flamma</p>

<p>Saucius hirsutis avidum de crinibus ignem</p>

<p>ipsa facit gravitas: socium quoque saxea moles</p>
<p>oppressit spatio stantem propiore Cometen.</p>
<p>Gaudia nec retinet Rhoetus: "Sic, conprecor," inquit</p>
<p>"cetera sit fortis castrorum turba tuorum!"</p>
<p>semicremoque novat repetitum stipite vulnus,</p>
<p>terque quaterque gravi iuncturas verticis ictu</p>

<p>Victor ad Euagrum Corythumque Dryantaque transit;</p>
<p>e quibus ut prima tectus lanugine malas</p>
<p>procubuit Corythus, "puero quae gloria fuso</p>
<p>parta tibi est?" Euagrus ait, nec dicere Rhoetus</p>
<p>plura sinit rutilasque ferox in aperta loquentis</p>
<p>condidit ora viri perque os in pectora flammas.</p>
<p>Te quoque, saeve Drya, circum caput igne rotato</p>
<p>insequitur; sed non in te quoque constitit idem</p>
<p>exitus: adsiduae successu caedis ovantem,</p>
<p>qua iuncta est umero cervix, sude figis obusta.</p>
<p>Ingemuit duroque sudem vix osse revellit</p>
<p>Rhoetus et ipse suo madefactus sanguine fugit.</p>
<p>Fugit et Orneus Lycabasque et saucius armo</p>
<p>dexteriore Medon et cum Pisenore Thaumas,</p>
<p>quique pedum nuper certamine vicerat omnes</p>
<p>Mermeros (accepto tum vulnere tardius ibat!),</p>
<p>et Pholus et Melaneus et Abas praedator aprorum,</p>
<p>quique suis frustra bellum dissuaserat augur,</p>
<p>Astylos: ille etiam metuenti vulnera Nesso</p>
<p>"ne fuge! ad Herculeos" inquit "servaberis arcus."</p>
<p>At non Eurynomus Lycidasque et Areos et Imbreus</p>
<p>effugere necem: quos omnes dextra Dryantis</p>
<p>perculit adversos. Adversum tu quoque, quamvis</p>
<p>terga fugae dederas, vulnus, Crenaee, tulisti;</p>
<p>nam grave respiciens inter duo lumina ferrum,</p>
<p>qua naris fronti committitur, accipis, imae.</p>
<p>In tanto fremitu cunctis sine fine iacebat</p>
<p>sopitus venis et inexperrectus Aphidas</p>
<p>languentique manu carchesia mixta tenebat,</p>
<p>fusus in Ossaeae villosis pellibus ursae.</p>
<p>Quem procul ut vidit frustra nulla arma moventem,</p>
<p>inserit amento digitos "miscenda" que dixit</p>
<p>"cum Styge vina bibes!" Phorbas; nec plura moratus</p>
<p>in iuvenem torsit iaculum, ferrataque collo</p>
<p>fraxinus, ut casu iacuit resupinus, adacta est.</p>
<p>Mors caruit sensu, plenoque e gutture fluxit</p>
<p>inque toros inque ipsa niger carchesia sanguis.</p>
<p>Vidi ego Petraeum conantem tollere terra</p>
<p>glandiferam quercum; quam dum conplexibus ambit</p>
<p>et quatit huc illuc labefactaque robora iactat,</p>
<p>lancea Pirithoi costis inmissa Petraei</p>
<p>pectora cum duro luctantia robore fixit.</p>
<p>Pirithoi cecidisse Lycum virtute ferebant,</p>
<p>Pirithoi virtute Chromin. Sed uterque minorem</p>
<p>victori titulum quam Dictys Helopsque dederunt:</p>
<p>fixus Helops iaculo, quod pervia tempora fecit</p>
<p>et missum a dextra laevam penetravit ad aurem;</p>
<p>Dictys, ab ancipiti delapsus acumine montis,</p>
<p>dum fugit instantem trepidans Ixione natum,</p>
<p>decidit in praeceps et pondere corporis ornum</p>
<p>ingentem fregit suaque induit ilia fractae.</p>
<p>Victor adest Aphareus saxumque e monte revulsum</p>
<p>mittere conatur: mittentem stipite querno</p>
<p>occupat Aegides cubitique ingentia frangit</p>
<p>ossa; nec ulterius dare corpus inutile leto</p>
<p>aut vacat aut curat tergoque Bienoris alti</p>
<p>insilit haud solito quemquam portare nisi ipsum,</p>
<p>opposuitque genu costis prensamque sinistra</p>
<p>caesariem retinens vultum minitantiaque ora</p>
<p>robore nodoso praeduraque tempora fregit:</p>
<p>robore Nedymnum iaculatoremque Lycopen</p>
<p>sternit et inmissa protectum pectora barba</p>
<p>Hippason et summis exstantem Riphea silvis</p>
<p>Thereaque, Haemoniis qui prensos montibus ursos</p>
<p>ferre domum vivos indignantesque solebat.</p>
<p>Haud tulit utentem pugnae successibus ultra</p>
<p>Thesea Demoleon: solido divellere dumo</p>
<p>annosam pinum magno molimine temptat;</p>
<p>quod quia non potuit, praefractam misit in hostem.</p>
<p>Sed procul a telo Theseus veniente recessit</p>
<p>Pallados admonitu: credi sic ipse volebat.</p>
<p>Non tamen arbor iners cecidit; nam Crantoris alti</p>
<p>abscidit iugulo pectusque umerumque sinistrum.</p>
<p>Armiger ille tui fuerat genitoris, Achille,</p>
<p>quem Dolopum rector, bello superatus, Amyntor</p>
<p>Aeacidae dederat pacis pignusque fidemque.</p>
<p>Hunc procul ut foedo disiectum vulnere Peleus</p>
<p>vidit, "at inferias, iuvenum gratissime Crantor,</p>
<p>accipe" ait, validoque in Demoleonta lacerto</p>
<p>fraxineam misit, mentis quoque viribus, hastam.</p>
<p>Quae laterum cratem praerupit et ossibus haerens</p>
<p>intremuit. Trahit ille manu sine cuspide lignum</p>
<p>(id quoque vix sequitur), cuspis pulmone retenta est.</p>
<p>Ipse dolor vires animo dabat: aeger in hostem</p>
<p>erigitur pedibusque virum proculcat equinis.</p>
<p>Excipit ille ictus galea clipeoque sonanti</p>
<p>defensatque umeros praetentaque sustinet arma</p>
<p>perque armos uno duo pectora perforat ictu.</p>
<p>Ante tamen leto dederat Phlegraeon et Hylen</p>
<p>eminus, Iphinoum conlato Marte Claninque;</p>
<p>additur his Dorylas, qui tempora tecta gerebat</p>
<p>pelle lupi saevique vicem praestantia teli</p>
<p>cornua vara boum multo rubefacta cruore.</p>
<p>Huic ego (nam vires animus dabat) "adspice," dixi,</p>
<p>"quantum concedant nostro tua cornua ferro!"</p>
<p>et iaculum torsi; quod cum vitare nequiret,</p>
<p>opposuit dextram passurae vulnera fronti:</p>
<p>adfixa est cum fronte manus. Fit clamor, at illum</p>
<p>haerentem Peleus et acerbo vulnere victum</p>
<p>(stabat enim propior) mediam ferit ense sub alvum.</p>
<p>Prosiluit terraque ferox sua viscera traxit</p>
<p>tractaque calcavit calcataque rupit et illis</p>
<p>crura quoque inpediit et inani concidit alvo.</p>
<p>Nec te pugnantem tua, Cyllare, forma redemit,</p>
<p>si modo naturae formam concedimus illi:</p>
<p>barba erat incipiens, barbae color aureus, aurea</p>
<p>ex umeris medios coma dependebat in armos.</p>
<p>Gratus in ore vigor; cervix umerique manusque</p>
<p>pectoraque artificum laudatis proxima signis,</p>
<p>et quacumque vir est; nec equi mendosa sub illo</p>
<p>deteriorque viro facies: da colla caputque,</p>
<p>Castore dignus erit; sic tergum sessile, sic sunt</p>
<p>pectora celsa toris. Totus pice nigrior atra;</p>
<p>candida cauda tamen, color est quoque cruribus albus.</p>
<p>Multae illum petiere sua de gente, sed una</p>
<p>abstulit Hylonome, qua nulla decentior inter</p>
<p>semiferos altis habitavit femina silvis.</p>
<p>Haec et blanditiis et amando et amare fatendo</p>
<p>Cyllaron una tenet; cultus quoque, quantus in illis</p>
<p>esse potest membris, ut sit coma pectine levis,</p>
<p>ut modo rore maris, modo se violave rosave</p>
<p>inplicet, interdum candentia lilia gestet,</p>
<p>bisque die lapsis Pagasaeae vertice silvae</p>
<p>fontibus ora lavet, bis flumine corpora tingat,</p>
<p>nec nisi quae deceant electarumque ferarum</p>
<p>aut umero aut lateri praetendat vellera laevo.</p>
<p>Par amor est illis: errant in montibus una,</p>
<p>antra simul subeunt; et tum Lapitheia tecta</p>
<p>intrarant pariter, pariter fera bella gerebant.</p>
<p>Auctor in incerto est: iaculum de parte sinistra</p>
<p>venit et inferius qua collo pectora subsunt,</p>
<p>Cyllare, te fixit; parvo cor vulnere laesum</p>
<p>corpore cum toto post tela educta refrixit.</p>
<p>Protinus Hylonome morientes excipit artus</p>
<p>inpositaque manu vulnus fovet oraque ad ora</p>
<p>admovet atque animae fugienti obsistere temptat.</p>
<p>Ut videt exstinctum, dictis, quae clamor ad aures</p>
<p>arcuit ire meas, telo, quod inhaeserat illi,</p>
<p>incubuit moriensque suum conplexa maritum est.</p>
<p>Ante oculos stat et ille meos, qui sena leonum</p>
<p>vinxerat inter se conexis vellera nodis,</p>
<p>Phaeocomes, hominemque simul protectus equumque.</p>
<p>Codice qui misso, quem vix iuga bina moverent,</p>
<p>Tectaphon Oleniden a summo vertice fregit.</p>
<p>fracta volubilitas capitis latissima, perque os</p>
<p>perque cavas nares oculosque auresque cerebrum</p>
<p>molle fluit veluti concretum vimine querno</p>
<p>lac solet, utve liquor rari sub pondere cribri</p>
<p>manat et exprimitur per densa foramina spissus.</p>
<p>Ast ego, dum parat hic armis nudare iacentem,</p>
<p>(scit tuus hoc genitor) gladium spoliantis in ima</p>
<p>ilia demisi. Chthonius quoque Teleboasque</p>
<p>ense iacent nostro: ramum prior ille bifurcum</p>
<p>gesserat, hic iaculum; iaculo mihi vulnera fecit:</p>
<p>signa vides! adparet adhuc vetus inde cicatrix.</p>
<p>Tunc ego debueram capienda ad Pergama mitti,</p>
<p>tum poteram magni, si non superare, morari</p>
<p>Hectoris arma meis! Illo sed tempore nullus,</p>
<p>aut puer Hector erat, nunc me mea deficit aetas.</p>
<p>Quid tibi victorem gemini Periphanta Pyraethi,</p>
<p>Ampyca quid referam, qui quadrupedantis Echecli</p>
<p>fixit in adverso cornum sine cuspide vultu?</p>
<p>Vecte Pelethronium Macareus in pectus adacto</p>
<p>stravit Erigdupum, memini et venabula condi</p>
<p>inguine Nesseis manibus coniecta Cymeli.</p>
<p>Nec tu credideris tantum cecinisse futura</p>
<p>Ampyciden Mopsum: Mopso iaculante biformis</p>
<p>accubuit frustraque loqui temptavit Hodites</p>
<p>ad mentum lingua mentoque ad guttura fixo.</p>
<p>Quinque neci Caeneus dederat, Styphelumque Bromumque</p>
<p>Antimachumque Elymumque securiferumque Pyraechmen:</p>
<p>vulnera non memini, numerum nomenque notavi.</p>
<p>Provolat Emathii spoliis armatus Alesi,</p>
<p>quem dederat leto, membris et corpore Latreus</p>
<p>maximus: huic aetas inter iuvenemque senemque,</p>
<p>vis iuvenalis erat, variabant tempora cani.</p>
<p>Qui clipeo gladioque Macedoniaque sarisa</p>
<p>conspicuus faciemque obversus in agmen utrumque</p>
<p>armaque concussit certumque equitavit in orbem</p>
<p>verbaque tot fudit vacuas animosus in auras:</p>
<p>"Et te, Caeni, feram? Nam tu mihi femina semper,</p>
<p>tu mihi Caenis eris. Nec te natalis origo</p>
<p>commonuit, mentemque subit, quo praemia facto</p>
<p>quaque viri falsam speciem mercede parasti?</p>
<p>Quid sis nata, vide, vel quid sis passa, columque,</p>
<p>i, cape cum calathis et stamina pollice torque:</p>
<p>bella relinque viris." Iactanti talia Caeneus</p>
<p>extentum cursu missa latus eruit hasta,</p>
<p>qua vir equo commissus erat. Furit ille dolore</p>
<p>nudaque Phyllei iuvenis ferit ora sarisa.</p>
<p>Non secus haec resilit, quam tecti a culmine grando,</p>
<p>aut siquis parvo feriat cava tympana saxo.</p>
<p>Comminus adgreditur laterique recondere duro</p>
<p>luctatur gladium: gladio loca pervia non sunt.</p>
<p>"Haud tamen effugies! medio iugulaberis ense,</p>
<p>quandoquidem mucro est hebes" inquit et in latus ensem</p>
<p>obliquat longaque amplectitur ilia dextra.</p>
<p>Plaga facit gemitus in corpore marmoris icti,</p>
<p>fractaque dissiluit percusso lammina callo.</p>
<p>Ut satis inlaesos miranti praebuit artus,</p>
<p>"nunc age," ait Caeneus, "nostro tua corpora ferro</p>
<p>temptemus!" capuloque tenus demisit in armos</p>
<p>ensem fatiferum caecumque in viscera movit</p>
<p>versavitque manu vulnusque in vulnere fecit.</p>
<p>Ecce ruunt vasto rabidi clamore bimembres</p>
<p>telaque in hunc omnes unum mittuntque feruntque.</p>
<p>Tela retusa cadunt: manet inperfossus ab omni</p>
<p>inque cruentatus Caeneus Elateius ictu.</p>
<p>Fecerat attonitos nova res. "Heu dedecus ingens!"</p>
<p>Monychus exclamat, "populus superamur ab uno</p>
<p>vixque viro: quamquam ille vir est, nos segnibus actis</p>
<p>quod fuit ille, sumus! Quid membra inmania prosunt?</p>
<p>Quid geminae vires et quod fortissima rerum</p>
<p>in nobis duplex natura animalia iunxit?</p>
<p>Nec nos matre dea, nec nos Ixione natos</p>
<p>esse reor, qui tantus erat, Iunonis ut altae</p>
<p>spem caperet: nos semimari superamur ab hoste!</p>
<p>Saxa trabesque super totosque involvite montes</p>
<p>vivacemque animam missis elidite silvis!</p>
<p>silva premat fauces, et erit pro vulnere pondus."</p>
<p>Dixit et insanis deiectam viribus austri</p>
<p>forte trabem nactus validum coniecit in hostem</p>
<p>exemplumque fuit, parvoque in tempore nudus</p>
<p>arboris Othrys erat, nec habebat Pelion umbras.</p>
<p>Obrutus inmani tumulo sub pondere Caeneus</p>
<p>aestuat arboreo congestaque robora duris</p>
<p>fert umeris. Sed enim postquam super ora caputque</p>
<p>crevit onus neque habet, quas ducat, spiritus auras,</p>
<p>deficit interdum, modo se super aera frustra</p>
<p>tollere conatur iactasque evolvere silvas,</p>
<p>interdumque movet, veluti, quam cernimus, ecce,</p>
<p>ardua si terrae quatiatur motibus Ide.</p>
<p>Exitus in dubio est: alii sub inania corpus</p>
<p>Tartara detrusum silvarum mole ferebant;</p>
<p>abnuit Ampycides medioque ex aggere fulvis</p>
<p>vidit avem pennis liquidas exire sub auras,</p>
<p>quae mihi tum primum, tunc est conspecta supremum.</p>
<p>Hanc ubi lustrantem leni sua castra volatu</p>
<p>Mopsus et ingenti circum clangore sonantem</p>
<p>adspexit pariterque animis oculisque secutus</p>
<p>"o salve" dixit, "Lapithaeae gloria gentis,</p>
<p>maxime vir quondam, sed nunc avis unica, Caeneu!"</p>
<p>Credita res auctore suo est: dolor addidit iram,</p>
<p>oppressumque aegre tulimus tot ab hostibus unum;</p>
<p>nec prius abstitimus ferro exercere dolorem,</p>
<p>quam data pars leto, partem fuga noxque removit."</p>
