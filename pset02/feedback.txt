An excellent start!

I know you might still be working on your game, but while you do, some
advice:

* It might be good to make each separate command its own method,
  either on the Player or as functions elsewhere.  You can even keep
  the set of functions in a dictionary and look up which one to use
  based on the first word in the command.  Gotta love functions being
  first class.

* It's a little weird to have all your rooms and items be globals.
  You might want to have them as things you set up in some kind of
  play_game() or initialize_game() function.

* It might be good to have each item be its own class, with its own
  use() method, so you don't have to dispatch yourself based on what
  the string of the item is.

* Variable names better than "item01" and "item02" and "room 06" might
  be useful.

* Here's an error I noticed when running your game:

  File "adventure1.py", line 70, in look
    "You do not see a " + target + " here."
TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'Item' objects

Let enne and I know if and when you consider yourself satisfied, and
one of us would be glad to take a look at it again.  (if you're
satisfied now, that's totally fine too)
