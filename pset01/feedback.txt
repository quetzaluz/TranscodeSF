Congradulations on completing the first howework assignment!

Here's some feedback on what you turned in:

* When you're getting a box from input, it might feel generally
  cleaner to avoid putting the values into their corresponding fields
  in the class until they're fully parsed into the numbers that you
  want.  Your check_box function is a little weird in that manner.

  Here's an example of an api that would be a little more pleasant to
  use for creating boxes:

  class Box:
    def __init__(self, x, y, width, height):
    	"""Initialize a Box from the top left point indicated by 
	(x, y) and the given width and height.  x, y, width, and height
    	must all be numbers."""
  
  # this function exists outside any class.
  def parseBox():
      """Ask the user to enter values for a box, and return it"""

* Your parsing code has a lot of repitition to it.  It would be better
  if you had one function for parsing an int and looping until you had
  a good value, and then called that function for every int you wanted
  to parse.

* Are all widths and heights whole integers?  What happens if they're
  negative?

* The general idea of this assignment is that you're designing a box
  library.  It is generally considered frustrating to people using
  your library if calling various methods in it (such as 'intersect')
  print messages and demand input A better method of error handling
  would be raising an exception.

* How did you test your code?  Did you write another script that used
  the Box? If so, can you include it and email so I can test it out?
  Maybe you used the python repl, which is also fine.

* I didn't fully test your code, but here's one thing I noticed about
  how it works: It turns out that when I intersect a box with another
  box that is completely inside it, I don't get the outer box to be
  the same as the inner one.
