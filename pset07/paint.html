    <h2>Make your own version of Paint</h2>
    <p>The above is a HTML <tt>canvas</tt> and a group of <tt>div</tt>s with
    colors, and <tt>id</tt>s of the names of their colors. Your job is to turn
    it into a paint program, similar to the old mspaint you may
    remember. Remember, for this pset it will be best to
    use <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a>,
    since some of the APIs are different on other browsers.</p>

    <p>All the HTML you need to get started is right here in this file, so
    you'll be focusing your efforts on <tt>paint.js</tt>.  Over there, what you
    see is an init() function that is called when the HTML is done loading.  It
    sets up the canvas to be ready to go, and creates a "context" from that
    canvas that you can draw on.</p>

    <p>One thing you may find useful is the <tt>each</tt> function included in
    the javascript file.  See if you can figure out what it does. Hint: try this
    in the javascript console&mdash;</p>

    <pre>
      var o = {
        licorice: "black",
        eggplant: "purple",
        blueberries: "blue"
      }
      each(o, function (val, key) {
        console.log(key, val);
      });
    </pre>

    <p> Since we'll be using the HTML5 Canvas for this paint program, take some
    time to
    read <a href="http://blog.pluralsight.com/2012/10/16/getting-started-with-the-html5-canvas/">this
    tutorial</a>.  Especially pay attention to
    the <tt>moveTo</tt>, <tt>startPath</tt>, and <tt>stroke</tt> functions,
    because we'll be getting some good mileage out of them.</p>

    <p>Now that you've learned a little about the canvas, actually build a paint
    program.  Here's the order I would suggest you'd do things in.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Write a function to set up the toolbar <tt>div</tt>s above to be
      clickable.  You already have an object, <tt>COLORS</tt> with all their ids
      which are also the CSS code for their colors; write a loop
      to <tt>addEventListener</tt> for the <tt>'click'</tt> event to each of
      them that sets the pen color appropriately.  For now,
      use <tt>console.log</tt> to make sure you're getting to the click handler
      when you're clicking it, and setting the color to the right thing.  Then
      call your function from <tt>init</tt></li>

      <li>Write a function to handle what happens when you press the mouse
      button down on the canvas (perhaps you start drawing at wherever the mouse
      is?).  Add it as a <tt>'mousedown'</tt> event handler on the
      canvas. Remember, an event handler is a function that takes an event as an
      argument. Maybe use <tt>console.log</tt> to record the event's offsetX and
      offsetY properties.</li>

      <li>Write a function to handle what happens when the mouse button is
      released.  Add it as a <tt>'mouseup'</tt> event handler on the
      canvas.</li>

      <li>Write a function to handle what happens when you move the mouse.  This
      should be where you actually put pixels on the canvas.  Attach it as
      a <tt>'mousemove'</tt> event handler on the canvas.</li>
    </ul>

    After doing these things, you should have a working basic paint program!
    Here are some optional additions to this project:

    <ul>
      <li>A rectangle tool</li>
      <li>An eraser</li>
      <li>A clear button to clear the canvas</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
