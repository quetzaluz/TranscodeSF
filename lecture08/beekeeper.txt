The Beekeeper's Apprentice

By Laurie R. King

Review by Naomi Seyfer

The Beekeeper's Apprentice is Sherlock Holmes fanfic.  I mean, don't get me
wrong, it's published and all, but King says herself she started the book with
the premise of "what if Sherlock Holmes was a woman?".

Sherlock isn't a woman in this book, but he does take a young woman, Marry
Russel, as an apprentice.  She's just as smart as he is, if a little less
experienced, and has her own personality quirks -- and she's the protagonist,
not Sherlock. One thing I like a little less, though, is that eventually
(spoiler) Russell starts developing romantic feelings for Holmes, and they do
eventually get married, once Holmes finds he can actually see her as his equal.
Not only does this seem to go against the cannon of a mostly-asexual Holmes, but
Russel and Holmes have quite an age difference, that I am not sure is beliveably
overcome to form a social-power equality, simply by dint Russel being *that*
awesome.

Somehow, this all ends up working remarkably well as its own setup for a set of
suspense novels.  They're not really mystery, in the calssical sense,
unfortunately.  You don't end up guessing whodoneit until the author shows you
how you could have guessed all along, but it's a good suspenseful story
nonetheless.
