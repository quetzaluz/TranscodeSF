<p>by Lois McMaster Bujold</p>

<p>Review by Naomi Seyfer</p>

<div class="review-text"</div>
<p><i>A Civil Campaign</i> is science fiction, but it's more than that.  It's a romance,
but it's more than that.  It's a comedy of manners, but it's more than that.
And a spy novel, and ...</p>

<p>Bujold does a masterful job of tying quite a few plot threads together neatly,
and intersperses this with more character development than you can shake a stick
at.  This is the book that, more than any other in the series, makes me realize
how Miles's story is mostly written from Miles's perspective -- and maybe he
isn't as awesome as he makes himself out to be.  He makes excuses for himself,
generally acts entitled a lot of the time, and ... still manages to be
sympathetic, because he's starting to realize how insufferable he's been all
this time. When the person he's trying to impress isn't dazzled by his reality
distortion field, he has to work on being a better person.</p>

<p>Add to that at least two great B plots involving such gems as bugs that extrude
a superfood and new characters like Lord Donno Vorreateur and his entourage, and
you have one of the strongest books yet in the Vorkosigan series.</p>

<h2 id="bee">The Beekeeper's Apprentice</h2>
<img src="./beekeeper.jpg"/>
<p>By Laurie R. King</p>

<p>Review by Naomi Seyfer</p>
<div class="review-text">
<p><i>The Beekeeper's Apprentice</i> is Sherlock Holmes fanfic.  I mean, don't get me
wrong, it's published and all, but King says herself she started the book with
the premise of "what if Sherlock Holmes was a woman?".</p>

<p>Sherlock isn't a woman in this book, but he does take a young woman, Marry
Russel, as an apprentice.  She's just as smart as he is, if a little less
experienced, and has her own personality quirks -- and she's the protagonist,
not Sherlock. One thing I like a little less, though, is that eventually
<span class="spoiler">Russell starts developing romantic feelings for Holmes, and they do
eventually get married, once Holmes finds he can actually see her as his equal.
Not only does this seem to go against the cannon of a mostly-asexual Holmes, but
Russel and Holmes have quite an age difference, that I am not sure is beliveably
overcome to form a social-power equality, simply by dint Russel being *that*
awesome.</span></p>

<p>Somehow, this all ends up working remarkably well as its own setup for a set of
suspense novels.  They're not really mystery, in the calssical sense,
unfortunately.  You don't end up guessing whodoneit until the author shows you
how you could have guessed all along, but it's a good suspenseful story
nonetheless.</p>
