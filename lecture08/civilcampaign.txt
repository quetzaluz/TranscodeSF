A Civil Campaign

by Lois McMaster Bujold

Review by Naomi Seyfer

A Civil Campaign is science fiction, but it's more than that.  It's a romance,
but it's more than that.  It's a comedy of manners, but it's more than that.
And a spy novel, and ...

Bujold does a masterful job of tying quite a few plot threads together neatly,
and intersperses this with more character development than you can shake a stick
at.  This is the book that, more than any other in the series, makes me realize
how Miles's story is mostly written from Miles's perspective -- and maybe he
isn't as awesome as he makes himself out to be.  He makes excuses for himself,
generally acts entitled a lot of the time, and ... still manages to be
sympathetic, because he's starting to realize how insufferable he's been all
this time. When the person he's trying to impress isn't dazzled by his reality
distortion field, he has to work on being a better person.

Add to that at least two great B plots involving such gems as bugs that extrude
a superfood and new characters like Lord Donno Vorreateur and his entourage, and
you have one of the strongest books yet in the Vorkosigan series.
