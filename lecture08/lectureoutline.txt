* Intro to HTML
* A little history
* Paired tags
  - Tags can close themselves if necessary.
* Basic structure and formatting
* Tags can have properties
  - Links and anchors (make a TOC).
  - Images (put covers)
* Must be tree-structured.
  - Show non-tree
  - Some browsers can deal, but don't guarantee.

* Intro to CSS
  - Talk about how HTML was supposed to be semantic and structural,
    rather than formatting.
  - Talk about <div>s with classes, to add structure to a document.
  - (sorry "class" is such an overloaded term)
* Wrap things in divs, and make various things different garish colors, show the
  structure of the document
  - Talk about different ways you can represent colors. (hex, name)
  - Also take a look at structure with the dev console
* Make the TOC a sidebar (float, width), (position:absolute, width)
  - Talk about different ways you can represent lengths. (percent, px)
* Talk about margin vs. padding
* Make images in reviews float right ( > selector)
* First-letter drop-caps (p:first-child:first-letter)
* Spoiler white-on-white
* Special format for author, review author.
* Justify

* Format sidebar
  - Remove list item decorators
  - Put list items in boxes
  - Fix margins
  - Remove text-decoration from links

* Talk about this in terms of how tedious it might have been to combine 20 or 30
  book reviews in -- how you really want a *program* to spit out this web site.

* In-class exercise:
  - Look in classresources for their own copy of what we did in class
  - Change the format in a specified way or two.
